# Getting Started with Create React App

This very ugly project is intended as practice for react hooks, bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

## React Hooks used

useState
useEffect
useRef
useContext
useReducer

### `npm start`

Runs this ugly app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
No real reason to do this.
